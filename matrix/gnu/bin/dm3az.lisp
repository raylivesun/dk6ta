;; Often you don't know what's in a list, and you want some forensic tools to ﬁnd out more
;; about what's inside it. newLISP has a good selection.
;; We've already met length, which ﬁnds the number of elements in a list.
;; The starts-with and ends-with functions test the start and ends of lists:
(for (c (char "a") (char "z"))
